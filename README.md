# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction

•	Goal of this project is to implement machine learning model to predict customer churn of telecom company.
•	Used 80/20 training and testing data for model development.
•	Logistic regression prediction gave me around 81.62% accuracy for customer churn prediction and that has still scope for better prediction after optimization.
•	As a part of customer retention program, this model can help management to make correct decisions on their future plans
